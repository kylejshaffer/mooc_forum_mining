<h1>Independent Study in MOOC Forum Mining</h1>
<h2>Study Background</h2>
<p>This repo contains code and technical documentation for a research project in classifying posts within MOOC discussion forums. The MOOC was offered as a course through UNC's School of Information and Library Science in the Fall of 2013, and was hosted on the Coursera platform.</p>
<p>The motivation for the study was to provide an experimental basis for an automated tool to alert instructors to posts within forums that may warrant manual intervention. MOOCs are extremely popular in their initial enrollment with thousands of students enrolling in courses in a very short amount of time. This makes course management extremely challenging, and this challenge presents an opportunity for automated machine learning tools to help predict which posts instructors should focus on.
