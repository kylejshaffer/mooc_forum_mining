		<h4>
			A massive open online course (<a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>)
			is an online course that is open for anyone to enroll and
			participate. MOOCs are typically free of cost and are taken by
			thousands of students. Students progress through a MOOC by watching
			pre-recorded lecture videos, completing assignments, taking exams,
			and interacting with each other and the course staff using an online
			discussion forum.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			Your goal in this HIT is to annotate a post from a MOOC discussion
			thread based on the <u>speech acts</u> that are present in the post.
			If you treat a MOOC discussion thread as a "conversation", the <u>speech
				acts</u> associated with a post indicate its <u>function</u> or <u>purpose</u>
			within the greater conversation.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			We are interested in <u>six</u> speech act categories, defined below.
			It is possible for a post to be associated with more than one speech
			act or none.
		</h4>

		<h4>Read the following speech act definitions carefully. For each
			speech act, we provide its definition, tips for recognizing the
			speech act, and examples. The "false" examples are posts that might
			be confused with the particular speech act, but should be labeled
			differently.</h4>

		<h4>
			When you label a post, ask yourself: <u>What is the purpose of
				the post within the context of the ongoing conversation?</u> What is the
			author trying to achieve? You may need to review the context of the
			post (the posts leading-up to it) to understand the function of the
			post in the ongoing conversation. Then, select all of the speech act
			categories that apply.
		</h4>

		<h4>If none of the speech acts apply, or if the post is not in
			English, select "Non-English or N/A".</h4>

		<h4>We will also ask you to explain your choice(s).</h4>

		<h4>
			You will be labeling posts written by real students and course staff
			from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/metadata">this MOOC</a>.

						<th><b>QUESTION:</b> The post contains a request for
							information about something related to the course material.</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional Tips:</b><br> 1. Questions can be expressed
									indirectly in the form of a statement: "I need help
									understanding question 3 in the homework."<br> <br>
											2. Questions are typically answered by a clarification,
											elaboation, recommendation, or a yes/no response.<br> <br>
													3. If the post contains a <u>request for action from
														the instructor</u>, then it should be labeled as an <b>issue</b>
													rather than a <b>question</b>.<br> <br> 4. From
															an instructor's perspective, questions are not
															necessarily bad. Asking questions and obtaining answers
															is part of a student's learning experience. 
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Question:</b> "In Question 8
								on the assignment I'm confused about code formatting. In
								lectures, the instructor said syntax should follow the form
								________, but do you have to include _________? Any ideas what
								I'm doing wrong?"<br> <br> <b>False Question:</b> "I'm
										barely keeping up with class lectures. Am I the only one who
										feels like the professor is going way too fast?"<br> <br>
												This should be labeled as an <b>issue</b> because it
												describes a student's disatissfaction with the pace of the
												course and doesn't request additional information about
												course material. Implicitely, the student is asking the
												instructor to take corrective action (i.e., slow down the
												pace of the course).<br> <br>

							to help answer the question.</th>
					</tr>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional Tips:</b><br> 1. Answers typically contain a
									clarification, elaboration, recommendation, or yes/no response.<br>
										<br> 2. While an answer may not definitively resolve a
											question, it should be useful in some way.<br> <br>
													3. General feedback about a previously asked question
													(Example: "I had the same question.") should be labeled as
													a <b>positive-acknowledgement</b> instead of an answer 
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Answer:</b> "The answer here
								should be of the form _________, applying the concepts we've
								covered so far this week. Hopefully that helps."<br> <br>
										<b>False Answer:</b> "Our team has realized this is a problem
										when trying to submit assignments and we've notified the
										appropriate people at Coursera."<br> <br> This
												should be labeled as an <b>issue resolution</b> since it
												pertains mostly to the course logistics, including
												submitting assignments, and not directly to course material.<br>

					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional Tips:</b><br> 1. An issue must convey
									dissatisfaction with something related to the course.<br>
										<br> 2. An issue may require the instructor(s) or course
											staff to take corrective action.<br> <br> 3. An
													issue is not a request for information, but a request for
													action or awareness.<br> <br> 4. From an
															instructor's perspective, issues are a bad thing. They
															are not part of the learning experience. They convey
															dissatisfaction with the course content or course
															management 
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Issue:</b> "The wording for
								question 6 was confusing. It was ambiguous in two ways. Please
								consider revising the wording, or giving students the points for
								this question."<br> <br> <b>False Issue:</b> "I don't
										understand the distinction between concept X and concept Y.
										The professor made it seem like these were interchangeable,
										but now in the homework they look like different things. Any
										help is appreciated."<br> This should be labeled as a <b>question</b>
											since it is primarily conveying confusion on the part of the
											student and asking for help in the last sentence.<br> <br>

						<th><b>ISSUE RESOLUTION:</b> The post is a direct response to

					</tr>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional Tips:</b><br> 1. An Issue Resolution must be
									in response to an issue and not a question.<br> <br>
											2. An Issue Resolution may simply indicate that the
											instructor or course staff is aware of the issue. It may not
											necessarily indicate that the issue has been (or will be)
											resolved. 
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Issue Resolution:</b> "We are
								aware of a glitch in the submission form for Homework 2. As a
								result, the last question has been awarded to each student as a
								free point."<br> <br> <b>False Issue Resolution:</b>
										"I can see where you might think that. However, I think the
										instructor was trying to say ________ in the lecture."<br>
											This should be labeled as an <b>answer</b> since it attempts
											to provide additional information directly related to course
											content, specifically about a lecture.<br> <br>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional Tips:</b><br> 1. A positive acknowledgement
									may encourage a previous author, but not necessarily attempt to
									answer a question or resolve an issue.<br> <br> 2. A
											positive acknowledgement may not necessarily contain positive language. For example: "I don't get it either. I found this confusing too."<br><br>
											3. Be sure that the post in question is responding to a previous author's post. General positive posts about course content without responding to a previous post author should <b>not</b> be considered positive acknowledgement. 
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Positive Acknowledgement:</b>
								"I'm glad I'm not the only one stuck on this! This was
								definitely confusing for me too!"<br> <br>
								<b>False Positive Acknowledgement:</b> "I don't understand the previous student's problem. I figure since this is a free course, we should be happy with that instead of complaining."<br>
								This should be labeled a <b>negative acknowledgement</b>. Although the student is defending the course in a positive way, the primary reference for this post is in opposition to a previous post.<br><br>

					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>
								<b>Additional tips:</b><br> 1. Negative acknowledgements
									reference a previous student's post. If the negative sentiment
									is about the course content, then it is an issue.<br> <br>
											2. Negative acknowledgments may urge an author to look at the
											course in a different way, indicating that their current
											attitude is unproductive or inappropriate. <br><br>
											3. Be sure that the post in question is responding to a previous author's post. General negative posts about course content should <b>not</b> be considered negative acknowledgement.
							</p> <b>Examples:</b><br> <b>True Negative Acknowledgement:</b>
								"Question 4 may have been difficult, but part of learning new
								material is working at it. No sense in complaining."<br> <br>
								<b>False Negative Acknowledgement #1:</b> "I have to say I'm frustrated that the homework hasn't been posted yet. It puts unnecessary pressure on students to release homework so close to the due date."
								<br>This should be labeled as an <b>issue</b> since it primarily references course logistics and <i>not</i> another student's post. <br><br>
								<b>False Negative Acknowledgement #2:</b> "Agreed. It was frustrating not getting the first two questions right and having to submit them over and over again."<br>
								This should be labeled as a <b>positive acknowledgement</b>. Although the post is expressing frustration, it is primarily agreeing with a previous post.
