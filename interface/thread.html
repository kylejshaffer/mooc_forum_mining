						Hello,<br></br>

						I'm writing to find out why LCSH are being taught based on the book form. LC has a rather helpful web portal for finding a subject heading, but this was not discussed in the lecture. It seems a little odd tha tin a world conditioned to Google, Wikipedia, et al., one would focus on the book form, especially when the course is intended for a broader audience than just librarians.<br></br>
							
						Related, the terminology used by LC on the web differs slightly from that used in the video lecture. Can the professor elaborate on these issues here or in a future video?<br></br>

						Thanks!<br></br>

						It seems to me that the book was used as an illustration of a controlled vocabulary thesaurus. He wasn't trying to teach us how to use the LCSH in a professional sense for cataloging purposes.<br></br>

						What is the difference in terminology that you mention?<br></br>

						Exactly. We are not being being taught to catalogue and LCSH is being used as an example. I imagine one consideration is that the formatting of the print version is clear and easy to read and also fits nicely onto the screen. If you were running the course you may have chosen a different example for a different reason, but there is no need to complain because the lecturer didn't do as you would.

						I've never seen the word "variant" used on the LC site.  Doing a quick search, those seem to be what appears as "See: _____"

						The LCSH web portal targets a more diverse audience than the LCSH printed reference set. People tend to understand the meaning of 'see' in the context of dictionaries and encyclopaedias whereas 'variant' may or may not connote an equivalent meaning.
